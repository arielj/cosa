# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

## Ruby version

2.5.3 (we should use 2.7.4)

## System dependencies

Ruby
NodeJS (version 14 ideally if webpack complains about something)

## Configuration

Copy `config/database.yml.sample` as `config/database.yml` and set up the database

## Database creation

Run `rails db:setup`. This will create the databases, run migrations and seeds.

## How to run the test suite

Run `rails spec`.
